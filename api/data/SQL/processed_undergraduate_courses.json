Students will develop their scientific writing skills to report their preliminary research findings in a research proposal. Such proposal must be planned and completed under the supervision of a faculty (advisor) and, at the advisor\u2019s discretion and department approval, may be reviewed by an additional co-advisor. Student will have to present to a committee his/her research plan and hypothesis in the thesis proposal.",

In this course, students will refine their thesis proposal in previous thesis course and work closely with the advisor to demonstrate their research findings over one semester in a professional field. This requires students to ensure the novelty and originality of the idea, conduct extensive research to validate the main hypothesis and research questions, and have the skills needed to write the thesis and prepare the research results for the proper venue for possible publication. Students will learn to develop their professional communication skills to defend their thesis in front of an independent scientific committee and possibly to deliver speech in a research symposia.",

    "description": "This is an independent research course focused on making research contributions and presenting the results in a thesis for students undertaking the CX in undergraduate research. In this course, students will refine their thesis proposal in previous thesis course and work closely with the advisor to demonstrate their research findings over one semester in a professional field. This requires students to ensure the novelty and originality of the idea, conduct extensive research to validate the main hypothesis and research questions, and have the skills needed to write the thesis and prepare the research results for the proper venue for possible publication. Students will learn to develop their professional communication skills to defend their thesis in front of an independent scientific committee and possibly to deliver speech in a research symposia.",

This course will facilitate the ground work completed in every respect to complete the meaningful projects in ME 415 from the day 1 of the project. And the proposal should be in a prescribed form with Gantt chart, and budget with material procurement forms (strategy and approval of ME workshop as well as other lab resources commitment), expected project deliverables and well defined roles of multiple faculty (if involved) in supervision of the project. The video lectures of the ME 414 with all prescribed forms with instructions will be available to all the enrolled students on the Web with some model (sample) project proposals. Team design projects, where appropriate, are highly encouraged. Students will work closely with their project adviser and are expected to spend about 3 hours per week /per student on the project.",
