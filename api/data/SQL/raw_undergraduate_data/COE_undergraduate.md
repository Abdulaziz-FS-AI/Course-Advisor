 Undergraduate Thesis I0 - 0 - 3
----------------------------------------

This course is an independent research course for students undertaking the CX in undergraduate research. An undergraduate thesis is a substantive piece of research-oriented creative work demonstrating mastery over the discourse of one semester in professional field. A thesis requires students to formulate the main hypothesis and research questions, maintain research integrity and be aware of research misconducts, and acquire skills of identifying research gaps in literature. Students will develop their scientific writing skills to report their preliminary research findings in a research proposal. Such proposal must be planned and completed under the supervision of a faculty (advisor) and, at the advisor’s discretion and department approval, may be reviewed by an additional co-advisor. Student will have to present to a committee his/her research plan and hypothesis in the thesis proposal.

COE 496
 Undergraduate Thesis II0 - 0 - 3
-----------------------------------------

This is an independent research course focused on making research contributions and presenting the results in a thesis for students undertaking the CX in undergraduate research. In this course, students will refine their thesis proposal in previous thesis course and work closely with the advisor to demonstrate their research findings over one semester in a professional field. This requires students to ensure the novelty and originality of the idea, conduct extensive research to validate the main hypothesis and research questions, and have the skills needed to write the thesis and prepare the research results for the proper venue for possible publication. Students will learn to develop their professional communication skills to defend their thesis in front of an independent scientific committee and possibly to deliver speech in a research symposia.

**Pre-Requisites:** COE 494

COE 497
 Undergraduate Research3 - 0 - 3
----------------------------------------

The course is intended to expose the student to the process of scientific research. The student is expected to acquire research skills and methodologies including formulation of a research plan, organization of a literature review, selection of appropriate research methodologies, design and implementation, assessment, analysis, and presentation. By the end of the course, students will complete a technical paper and will be encouraged to participate in conferences and present their work.
Prerequisite: Junior Standing and a minimum GPA of 3 out of 4

COE 499
