### Environmental Science & Engg.

ESE 231
 Fundamentals of Environmental Science and Engineering3 - 0 - 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fundamentals related to environmental pollution
sources and effects; ecology and environment;
sustainable practices for environmental
protection; water and wastewater management;
ambient air quality and Process Air Pollution Control;
modern practices in solid waste management and
recycling; industrial hazardous wastes management;
noise, marine and nuclear related pollution issues.

**Pre-Requisites:** CHEM 101

ESE 371
 Environmental Engineering Lab0 - 3 - 1
-----------------------------------------------

Introduction to professional environmental
engineering laboratory practices; Bench scale
experiments related to environmental engineering
operations and processes including chemical
equilibrium, chemical kinetics, adsorption,
precipitation, coagulation, flocculation,
sedimentation (Types I & II), water softening, and ion
exchange.

**Pre-Requisites:** CHEM 101

ESE 399
 Summer Training0 - 0 - 1
---------------------------------

A continuous period of eight weeks of summer
working in the industry to gain exposure and
appreciation of the environmental science and
engineering profession. On-the-job training can be
acquired in one of the specialties of environmental
science and engineering. The student is required to
write a brief report about his industrial experience.
The report should emphasize duties assigned and
completed by the student.

**Pre-Requisites:** ENGL 214

ESE 411
 Senior Design Project I0 - 1 - 0
-----------------------------------------

This is the first part of the capstone design course.
Students form teams to design a system on their own
that relates to environmental science and
engineering related issues. Students collect all the
relevant design information under the guidance of a
senior faculty.

ESE 412
 Senior Design Project II0 - 3 - 3
------------------------------------------

This is the second part of the environmental science
and engineering capsone design project; a
comprehensive design experience through a
coherent study of all applicable principles, strategies
and methodologies of design; Use of appropriate
factors such as alternative designs, economic
feasibility and social and environmental impacts.

**Pre-Requisites:** ESE 411

ESE 431
 Water Treatment & Reuse3 - 0 - 3
-----------------------------------------

Water quality regulations and water treatment
including turbidity control, hardness reduction, and
disinfection; Introduction to wastewater reuse;
Wastewater treatment including preliminary,
primary, secondary and advanced treatment
operations and processes for reuse purpose including
case studies.

ESE 432
 Solid & Hazardous Waste Mgmt.3 - 0 - 3
-----------------------------------------------

Integrated municipal solid waste management
practices including characterization of municipal solid
wastes and modern practices in waste resource
recovery, recycling, composting, incineration, and
landfill design. Industrial hazardous waste
management including regulations, environmental
audit, pollution prevention, reduce/recover/recycle
concepts, risk assessment, and treatment.

ESE 494
 Undergraduate Thesis I0 - 0 - 3
----------------------------------------

This course is an independent research course for students undertaking the CX in undergraduate research. An undergraduate thesis is a substantive piece of research-oriented creative work demonstrating mastery over the discourse of one semester in professional field. A thesis requires students to formulate the main hypothesis and research questions, maintain research integrity and be aware of research misconducts, and acquire skills of identifying research gaps in literature. Students will develop their scientific writing skills to report their preliminary research findings in a research proposal. Such proposal must be planned and completed under the supervision of a faculty (advisor) and, at the advisor’s discretion and department approval, may be reviewed by an additional co-advisor. Student will have to present to a committee his/her research plan and hypothesis in the thesis proposal.

ESE 496
 Undergraduate Thesis II0 - 0 - 3
-----------------------------------------

This is an independent research course focused on making research contributions and presenting the results in a thesis for students undertaking the CX in undergraduate research. In this course, students will refine their thesis proposal in previous thesis course and work closely with the advisor to demonstrate their research findings over one semester in a professional field. This requires students to ensure the novelty and originality of the idea, conduct extensive research to validate the main hypothesis and research questions, and have the skills needed to write the thesis and prepare the research results for the proper venue for possible publication. Students will learn to develop their professional communication skills to defend their thesis in front of an independent scientific committee and possibly to deliver speech in a research symposia.

**Pre-Requisites:** ESE 494
