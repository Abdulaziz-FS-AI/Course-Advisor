CPG 498
 Integrated Reservoir Studies0 - 6 - 2
----------------------------------------------

Use of geoscientific data, knowledge, and skills, as well as reservoir and well data, to build a geological model of a hydrocarbon trap. Uncertainties associated with petrophysical and field data. Work is achieved by a team of petroleum-engineering and geoscience students. Plan a development strategy aiming for increasing production/maximizing the oil recovery, consider production and drilling program, and perform economic analysis to identify the most profitable development scenario with all given constraints.

CPG 499
 Integrated Design II0 - 6 - 2
--------------------------------------

continuation of CPG498. Evaluation of various development plans for the hydrocarbon trap utilizing all petroleum engineering tools and skills' Selection of the best plan based on technical and economic feasibility within environmental and legal constrains following the industry's standards and practices. A detailed technical report with presentation.

**Pre-Requisites:** CPG 498
